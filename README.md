BLEPHAFLY THE TROPICAL FLY POKEMON

CAPTURED BY: Marty
CURRENT TRAINER: Robin

Blephafly is the evolved form of Blephalar, the tropical caterpillar pokemon. 
They are famous for their region-specific mating dances and colorful wing patterns.
Strangely, all Blephafly individuals seem to favor trainers named "Marty".

This one in particular thinks people named Robin are very smart and good at UNIX coding!
